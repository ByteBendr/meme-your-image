# Image Burn Effect Web App

A web application that allows users to upload an image, apply a dramatic "burn" effect, and download the altered image. This app provides three levels of intensity for the burn effect, ranging from mild to extreme, adding contrast, noise, and color tints to create a meme-worthy result.

- **Real-Time Updates**: Change the burn intensity in real-time and see the updated effect immediately.

- **Download**: Save the processed image with the applied burn effect.
